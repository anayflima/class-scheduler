# Sandbox

> The following files **DO NOT** compose the production code of the project

This directory was created to help developers share code snippets and documents
that are relevant to the project.

## Commits

Changes to this directory **should not** be committed in the `main` branch, but
rather, on the `sandbox` branch. All commits in this branch should be marked
with the conventional commits type `sand`, as in the following example:

```
sand: this is an example commit message
```
